## The Impact of Cycling on a Sustainable Future
Due to climate change and NYC transportation being the biggest contributors to carbon emissions. Central Bikes Company has launched "How Green is Cycling" campaign. The company aims to know the top five stations that are crowded to distribute its bikes to help in raising the awareness of the impact of cycling on a sustainable future and thus help in reducing the carbon emissions and to increase the customer experience.

1- 34 ST-Penn STA

2- GRD CNTRL-42 ST
