# Minimum Viable Product
## MTA New York Subway

This project aims to analyze New York City subway data to determine which stations are most crowded so that Central Bikes's bikes can be distributed to ensure the success of its "How green is cycling" campaign.

To begin exploring this goal, we started by doing an exploratory data analysis on a sample of the entire data to better understand it, then began visualizing based on the busiest station.

The figure shows the top 5 busiest stations over time. It may have significant implications for our central bike campaign. Despite this, the results do not reflect the overall success of this campaign since only one month's worth of analysis was examined.
